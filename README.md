This repository contains all submission items for the Project. In the Main Branch, the xxxx.py file contains our implementation for the Minesweeper Project. The xxx.pdf contains the pdf file for our 10 page Project Writeup. The xxx contains the Video/Presentation, the xxx contains the Presentation slidedeck, and the following link is for the Google Collab that will function as our demo. The code in the Collab is identical to the code in xxx.py. The following is documentation regarding a brief overview of the project and how to run the model.
